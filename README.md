# WhatsApp Analysis Application

## Overview

This project is a **WhatsApp Analysis Application** built using **Python 3.7** and **Streamlit** (version 1.23.1). The main goal of this application is to analyze data exported from any WhatsApp group chat, helping businesses and individuals to gain insights and make informed decisions based on chat patterns and interactions.

## Features

- **Data Loading**: Users can export their WhatsApp group data as a `.txt` file and load it into the application for analysis.
- **Flexible Analysis**: The tool can analyze messages, identify trends, and highlight important patterns, providing valuable data that can be used to enhance business strategies.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Thanks to Streamlit's capabilities, the application offers a simple and interactive interface that ensures ease of use for everyone.

## How to Use

1. **Export WhatsApp Group Data**:
   - Open your WhatsApp group chat.
   - Click on the group info or menu option, and select "Export Chat".
   - Save the exported `.txt` file.

2. **Load Data**:
   - Open the application.
   - Click on the "Browse" button to upload your exported `.txt` file.
   
3. **Analyze**:
   - Once the data is loaded, the application processes it and provides various metrics such as message frequency, user contributions, word analysis, and other relevant statistics.
   - This helps users gain insights into communication trends within their group.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have **Python 3.7** installed along with the following libraries:



```bash
